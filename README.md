# diabetes-prediction-ml

_**Overview:**_

This project implements a Machine Learning model to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various diagnostic measurements. The goal is to assist in early detection and risk assessment by leveraging data analysis and classification algorithms.

_**Key Features**_

The project pipeline includes the following stages:

**Dataset Acquisition:** Importing the relevant diabetes dataset (e.g., Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset).

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, addressing outliers, and ensuring data quality and usability.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the dataset to uncover patterns, anomalies, and underlying relationships between features.

**Data Visualization:** Presenting key data insights in a graphical format for better understanding.

**Model Training:** Developing and training a suitable classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, or Random Forest) to predict the outcome.

_**Technologies Used**_

Python

Machine Learning Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn


_**Dataset:**_ [Diabetes Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
